# calremind

This is a thing I'm writing which will send me an alert in the evening if I have any early meetings the next morning.

#### Bugs:
* Doesn't work if local time zone is different from calendar time zone
* All-day events cause it to crash
* Deleted "ghost" events cause it to crash too (probably)
